# ns Programming Language
## :dard: Project Description/Goal
ns is meant to be a fast relatively powerful programming language.  Currently
it is interpreted, but soon I will likely write an assembly translation for
GNU assembler.

## :floppt_disk: Installation

## :star2: Currently Offered Features
Not a whole lot at the moment (but hopefully a lot soon).

## :scroll: Immediately on the List to be Implemented
- Complete parser
- Implement Type-Checking (probably a sub problem of parser)
- Implement basic control structures (if, while, etc.)
	- Implement in Eval
	- Make Symbol Table Entries
- Integrate matrix math library functionality
- Infix function notation
- Make Symbol Table Stack (i.e. allow language to have stack frames)
- Make some command line flags work
- Make UI nicer (for REPL)
- Assembly translation for GAS
